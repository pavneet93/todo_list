                             TODOLIST
                             
This project is about adding different items in todo list. This would 
allow user to make a list of data he plans to add in todo list.
It adds the elememts in the list and store them in the local storage.
This is beneficial for the user as the user has no not need to enter the  
information again as the system remembers it and automatically fills it for the 
same user.

User can perform various different functions in this todo list-
1. User can even delete the elememts from the list by simply clicking the Delete
button.
2. When user clicks on the list item it draws a strike on the item name that
 basically shows that particular task is done or no longer required.
